#  ERPNext on Docker

**The goal of this repo is stability.**

##### Problem

* ERPNext development tend to go very fast, new update comes every days 
and some will be bugs.

* ERPNext use many dependencies, during installation sometimes somethings might went wrong.

##### Solution

Using docker we can pre-build images and push it to [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pipech/erpnext-docker-debian/),
so you will always have usable images and can choose which version you want to use.
